3D printed brain matrix

Designed by Lex Kravitz (lex.kravitz@gmail.com)

This is a 3D printed brain matrix for use in mouse brain histology, the kind of thing that costs a few hundred dollars for a commercial plastic or steel part.  In my experience it does need to be printed in resin to get a good result. Original posting: https://hackaday.io/project/167972-mouse-brain-matrix.
